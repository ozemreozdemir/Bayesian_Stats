Bayesian Stats
=============================
Load the jittered head count data and the Las Vegas hourly weather data provided here.  
We will merge the data sets in 'Homework7_Start.RView in a new window'. 
Once these are merged, create linear model factors for various time/date variables, however you wish. 
You might also include an autoregressive variable, similar to the Dow Jones example in class. 
Report the Residual Standard Error and interpret this in a sentence. You might also look at the average error by day, aggregating the headcounts and predictions by day.
